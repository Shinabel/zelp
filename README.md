### Web Development Summer 1 2018

**Group members**: Abel Shin, Caitlin Wang

This is a repository for our final web development project in CS 4550. We will update this README and the Wiki with our progress throughout the semester.


# Zelp

People want a positive dining experience. And a positive dining experience is both **personal** and **situational**. They want to know where they can find an "affordable hot pot restaurant for a large party", the "most authentic taco place in downtown San Diego", or a "bar with good music and a pool table". 

**Zelp** is a social restaurant recommendation platform where users can ask for and give restaurant recommendations! üç£
